Abstract: Vibration is an inevitable phenomenon in production and life, and its harm should not be underestimated. In order to suppress vibration effectively, this paper takes cantilever beam as an example and studies the active vibration control problem by using numerical calculation thinking. A mathematical model based on Euler-Bernoulli beam equations is established. The finite difference method is used to discretized the beam dynamic equations, and the conjugate gradient method is used to solve the discretized linear equations. On this basis, controlling force is introduced by interpolation method to suppress vibration. The proportional feedback and PID control strategies are used for active vibration control respectively, and the comparative analysis is carried out. The numerical results show that the active control can effectively suppress the vibration.
